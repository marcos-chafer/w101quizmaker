# w101quizmaker

Chromium Extension that solves quizzes ASAP.

This extension has the answers to the questions of ten quizzes and will answer them as fast as it can.

This project started wanting to resolve ten quizzes with no human interaction, but due to captcha verification (and me not wanting to spend too much time on this) it ended being a single quiz solver.

## Installation

1. Download the zip
2. Extract it
3. Open your Chromium browser, and go to your extensions management page (e.g. chrome://extensions/)
4. Enable development mode
5. Click on "Load unpacked"
6. Select the folder containing the application
7. w101quizmaker is now installed in your Chromium browser

## Usage

1. Login into your w101 account
2. Open the extension and select a quiz
3. Click start and let the extension do the job

## Bugs

If a question doesn't get answered, it's probably because of the question or the answer not being correctly added in the code, so please, feel free to tell me!
